# Job-Market-Analysis
I worked on a job postings dataset where I first cleaned the data and handled missing values. Then I explored hiring trends, contract types, and salary distribution. I also dealt with outliers so the salary plots made more sense and summarized the key insights.

## Overview

This project predicts salaries for data science professionals based on their qualifications, experience, and skills. Using text mining and predictive modeling techniques, it analyzes job postings to reveal trends such as dominant job titles, required skills, and the relationship between experience and salary. Key methods include web scraping, regular expression-based cleaning, and regression models.

### Key Insights and Visualizations:

1. **Top Job Profiles**:

   - Shows the most frequently occurring job roles in the dataset, indicating high-demand positions.

2. **Top Hiring Companies**:

   - Highlights companies with the highest number of job postings.

3. **Contract Type Distribution**:

   - Illustrates how job postings are distributed across different contract types.
4. **Salary Distribution**:

   -Displays the distribution of salaries after excluding extreme outliers to better understand typical salary ranges.

## Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib**

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Collected Dataset of 4,000 rows and 20 columns of job-market data from kaggle.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicate records, dropping unnecessary location-related columns, and verifying column consistency.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed exploratory analysis to understand hiring trends, job roles, contract types, and salary distribution using summary statistics and frequency analysis.
4. **Visualization**: Created bar charts and histograms to visualize job demand, company hiring trends, contract distribution, and salary patterns.


## Features

### Current Features

- Performs exploratory data analysis on a real-world job market dataset
- Analyzes job posting trends such as popular job roles, hiring companies, and contract types
- Visualizes insights using bar charts and histograms for better understanding

### Future Enhancements

- Add machine learning models to predict salaries based on job-related features
- Expand analysis to include skill-based demand and role-wise salary prediction
- Incorporate more datasets to study long-term job market trends

## Status

- **Completed**: The core data analysis project is complete, with clean data, exploratory analysis, and visualized insights.

## Challenges

- Handling a large number of missing values in key columns such as salary and contract type.
- Identifying and managing extreme salary outliers to ensure meaningful visualizations.
- Deciding which columns and analyses were relevant and which could be excluded.

## Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience in cleaning real-world datasets.
- Improved understanding of exploratory data analysis and interpreting trends from data.
- Learned how outliers and missing data can significantly affect analysis and visualizations.
